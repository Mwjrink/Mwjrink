# Profile
A highly creative and enthusiastic software developer with proven experience in database optimization, desktop and
web UI frameworks, servers, web sockets, low-level concurrency, and graphics code. Proficient in working in low-level,
backend areas, where the problems are more algorithmic and complex. Currently working on high-performance Rust
programming, a markdown editor and implementing a Vulkan renderer to replicate unreal engine 5’s nanite from
scratch. Exceptional communicator and consensus builder who can work with cross-functional teams to create a
synergistic collaboration that moves technical projects forward.

      Uses similar techniques to what nanite has done with preprocessing meshes into DAGs of clusters, streaming and culling of clusters and rendering the appropriate cluster for the current LOD
