A highly creative and enthusiastic software developer with proven experience in database optimization, desktop and
web UI frameworks, servers, web sockets, low-level concurrency, and graphics code. Proficient in working in low-level,
backend areas, where the problems are more algorithmic and complex. Currently working on high-performance Rust
programming, a markdown editor and implementing a Vulkan renderer to replicate unreal engine 5â€™s nanite from
scratch. Exceptional communicator and consensus builder who can work with cross-functional teams to create a
synergistic collaboration that moves technical projects forward.
