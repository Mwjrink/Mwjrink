# Profile
I am an enthusiastic software developer currently working for Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. I am particularly interested in working with the rust language and low level, backend areas, where the problems are more algorithmic and complex. I have experience with database optimization, desktop and web UI frameworks, servers, web sockets, low-level concurrency and graphics code. I am currently working on high performance Rust programming and implementing a vulkan renderer attempting to replicate unreal engine 5s nanite from scratch.

      Objective: Familiarize myself with modern low level graphics APIs, and try to achieve something similar to what nanite has done (also its fun)<br/>
      Game engine level abstraction over the low level graphics API, Vulkan<br/>
      Uses similar techniques to what nanite has done with preprocessing meshes into DAGs of clusters, streaming and culling of clusters and rendering the appropriate cluster for the current LOD
